# What Code Editor do I use?
## General Text Editing
Recently, I found Helix editor to be a very nice code editor. Being very easily configurable and using easy to learn keybinds, programming has become more fun and easier to do.
Overall this has provided me with a lot of learning about text editors in general. You can find my opinionated config.toml on this github repository.
## What about for special things?
Well when I design applications to be used with apple devices, I use their built in xcode editor.
What about for Java development? Eclipse provides some very good debugging tools to allow me to program some of my minecraft mods in java.
## In the future what is the plan?
Sticking to Helix has allowed me to learn a lot more about the system that I use. Along with this, I have also riced my OS. Focused on quick and easy development Helix helps provide this.
However one must argue that the pull of AI development is very tempting, with limited AI support inbuilt into helix, you can easily see its shortfalls.
I am not one to vibe code frequently, but the use in quick development using AI is becoming an increasingly important skill. What does this mean for me? It means that I will continue to use EXTERNAL AI tools when neccicary for my projects, continuing with using helix for almost all of my projects.
## Will I try improve this?
In the background, I am working on porting some coding models to be run natively on my machine, while being integrated with the helix editor. I will keep working on this until it is either done, or someone else has come up with a better solution.
